## 💡 What is PingUp?

**PingUp** is a real-time community chat platform that brings people together through organized channels, direct messaging, and shared music experiences. It was built from scratch using React, Node.js, Socket.IO, and MongoDB.

Think of it as a lightweight, self-hostable Discord — with a clean forest-green aesthetic, a Stranger Things music lounge, and a powerful owner panel to manage your community in real time.

---

## ✨ Feature Overview

### 💬 Real-Time Messaging

- Instant messages delivered via **WebSockets (Socket.IO)** — zero page refreshes
- **Live typing indicators** with animated bouncing dots
- **Message pinning** — moderators can pin important messages, visible at the top of every channel
- **Soft message deletion** — deleted messages show `[message deleted]` rather than disappearing
- Auto-scroll to latest message on new activity

### 🗂️ Channel & Category System

- Channels are organized inside **collapsible categories** (exactly like Discord)
- Owners can create, delete, and rename channels and categories **live** — all users see updates instantly
- Each channel supports a custom **emoji** and **description**
- Per-channel toggleable settings:
  - 🔇 **Read-only** — only owners can send messages
  - 🔒 **Locked** — no one can send messages
  - 👁️ **Private** — only specific users can see and join
- Channel status badges displayed in the header and sidebar

### 🎵 Music Lounge (Voice Channel)

- A special **Stranger Things themed music lounge** channel
- Built-in **YouTube-powered audio player** — no API key required
- **Playlist of 5 tracks**:
  - 🌀 Stranger Things — Main Theme _(Kyle Dixon & Michael Stein)_
  - 🔴 Running Up That Hill _(Kate Bush)_
  - ⚡ Should I Stay or Should I Go _(The Clash)_
  - 🌊 Every Breath You Take _(The Police)_
  - 🔥 Master of Puppets _(Metallica)_
- Discord-style **lobby screen** before joining — shows who's listening
- Animated **spinning album art** with per-track colour theming
- Real-time **listening members** panel with sound wave animations
- Previous / Stop / Next controls + volume slider + mute toggle

### 👤 Role-Based Permissions

PingUp has a strict **3-tier role system**:

| Role             | Badge | Capabilities                      |
| ---------------- | ----- | --------------------------------- |
| 👑 **Owner**     | Gold  | Everything — full server control  |
| 🛡️ **Moderator** | Teal  | Delete/pin messages, kick members |
| 👤 **Member**    | Grey  | Send messages, read channels      |

- The **first user to register** is automatically made Owner
- Roles are enforced **server-side** — the client UI only reflects server decisions
- Role-coloured avatars, username colours, and pills throughout the entire UI

### 📨 Direct Messages (DMs)

- Private **1-on-1 conversations** between any users
- Persistent message history stored in MongoDB
- **Unread message badges** on the DM list
- **Toast pop-up notifications** for incoming DMs while in a channel
- Live typing indicators in DM conversations
- Click any username in the member panel to open a DM

### 🛡️ Admin Panel

- Full **server statistics**: total users, online count, messages, channels
- **User management table**: see all users, change roles, kick, or ban
- **Channel management**: create/delete channels, toggle read-only/lock/private
- All changes take effect **instantly** across all connected clients

### ⌨️ Slash Commands

Type `/help` in any channel for a full command list:

| Command                      | Who   | What it does                             |

## ⚡ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** v18 or higher — [download here](https://nodejs.org)
- **npm** v9+ (comes with Node.js)
- **MongoDB Atlas** account (free tier works) — [sign up here](https://mongodb.com/atlas)
- **Git** — [download here](https://git-scm.com)

---

### Step 1 — Clone Both Repositories

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
# Clone the frontend
git clone https://github.com/sabeenaviklar/PingUp-Frontend.git

# Clone the backend
git clone https://github.com/sabeenaviklar/PingUp-Backend.git
```

You'll now have two folders: `PingUp-Frontend/` and `PingUp-Backend/`

---

### Step 2 — Set Up MongoDB Atlas

1. Go to [mongodb.com/atlas](https://mongodb.com/atlas) and sign in
2. Create a **free cluster** (M0 tier)
3. Under **Database Access** → Add a new database user with username & password
4. Under **Network Access** → Add `0.0.0.0/0` (allow all IPs) for development
5. Click **Connect** → **Connect your application** → Copy the connection string

It will look like:

```
mongodb+srv://youruser:yourpassword@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/pingup
```

---

### Step 3 — Configure the Backend

```bash
cd PingUp-Backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `PingUp-Backend/` folder by copying the example:

```bash
# PingUp-Backend/.env (copy from .env.example)
cp .env.example .env
```

Then set your real values in `PingUp-Backend/.env`:

- `MONGO_URI`: your MongoDB Atlas connection string
- `JWT_SECRET`: a strong, unique secret (rotate if it was ever exposed)
- `PORT`: server port (e.g. `3001`)

> ⚠️ Never commit `.env` to GitHub. This repo includes `PingUp-Backend/.env.example` with placeholder values.

> ⚠️ **Never commit `.env` to GitHub.** Make sure it's in your `.gitignore`.

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev OR node server.js
```

You should see:

```
✅ MongoDB connected
✅ Default rooms seeded
🚀 Server on http://localhost:3001
```

---

### Step 4 — Configure the Frontend

Open a **new terminal window**, then:

```bash
cd PingUp-Frontend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `PingUp-Frontend/` folder:

```bash
# PingUp-Frontend/.env

VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:

```
  VITE v5.x.x  ready in xxx ms
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

---

### Step 5 — Open PingUp

1. Open **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)** in your browser
2. Click **Register** and create your first account
   - ✅ The **first user to register** is automatically made **Owner**
3. Open a **second browser tab or incognito window** and register another user
   - This user will be a **Member**
4. You can now chat between the two accounts in real time!

---

| Feature          | How to test                                                       |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Real-time chat   | Send messages from two different browser windows                  |
| Typing indicator | Start typing in one window — see it appear in the other           |
| Owner panel      | Log in as the first user → click **Admin Panel** in the sidebar   |
| Music lounge     | Click `#music-lounge` in the sidebar → Join Lounge → pick a track |
| Direct messages  | Click any online user in the right panel → start a DM             |
| Slash commands   | Type `/help` in any channel                                       |
| Channel settings | As owner, click the 🔇 🔒 👁️ buttons in the channel header        |
| Role management  | Admin Panel → Users → change a user's role                        |

message:send          { channelId, text }
typing:start          { channelId }
typing:stop           { channelId }
message:pin           { channelId, messageId }

users:update          → online users list changed
channel:history       → message history for joined channel
message:new           → new message arrived

dm:message            → new direct message received
dm:notification       → toast notification for new DM
```

---

## 🔐 Security

- Passwords hashed with **bcrypt** (10 salt rounds) — never stored in plain text
- All protected routes require a valid **JWT Bearer token** in the `Authorization` header
- Every Socket.IO connection is authenticated via **JWT middleware** at connection time
- Banned users are rejected at **both** the REST API and WebSocket level
- All permission checks (kick, ban, promote, toggle channel settings) are enforced **server-side only** — the client UI is cosmetic and cannot bypass server rules
- Private channel access verified on every `channel:join` event

---

## 🎨 Design System

PingUp uses a custom **forest/sage green** dark theme built entirely in CSS variables:

```css
--bg-primary: #1a2a22 /* Deep forest background */ --bg-secondary: #1e2f26
  /* Sidebar backgrounds */ --bg-elevated: #243322
  /* Cards, inputs, elevated surfaces */ --accent: #4a9e8e
  /* Teal green — buttons, active states */ --accent-hover: #5ab5a4
  /* Accent on hover */ --accent-muted: rgba(74, 158, 142, 0.12)
  /* Soft accent backgrounds */ --urgent: #bc6c25
  /* Warm amber — warnings, danger */ --text-primary: #e8f0ec
  /* Main text — soft white */ --text-muted: #7a9e8a
  /* Secondary text — muted sage */;
```

The Music Lounge overrides these with **per-track dynamic gradients** based on the currently playing song.
